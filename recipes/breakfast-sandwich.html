    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Classic Breakfast Sandwich is the kind of simple, satisfying meal that never goes out of style.

Every bite has a balance of textures—soft, gooey, crunchy, and toasty—making it a comforting go-to for busy mornings or a quick all-day breakfast fix.

You can keep it traditional, add sauces for extra personality, or swap protein and veggies to match your mood. Portable, hearty, and endlessly customizable, it’s a breakfast staple that always delivers.</p>
