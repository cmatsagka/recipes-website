    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fluffy Banana Pancakes are the perfect blend of comfort and simplicity, bringing together 
        sweet ripe bananas and a soft, cloud-like texture. Each bite is warm, tender, and fragrant, 
        with natural banana flavor shining through without being overly sweet. They cook up golden 
        and pillowy, making them ideal for slow mornings or effortless weeknight breakfasts.
    </p>
   
    <p>These pancakes are easy to prepare with everyday ingredients, and the batter comes together 
        in just minutes. They pair beautifully with maple syrup, fresh berries, or extra slices of
         banana, and they’re versatile enough to customize with chocolate chips, nuts, or spices.
         Whether you're cooking for yourself or serving a crowd, these pancakes offer a cozy, 
         satisfying start to any day.
