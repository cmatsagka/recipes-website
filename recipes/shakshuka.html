    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shakshuka is a vibrant, comforting dish where eggs are gently poached in a rich, spiced tomato and pepper sauce. The flavors are warm and aromatic—cumin, paprika, garlic, and sweet bell peppers simmer together to create a silky base that perfectly cradles the soft, runny eggs. The dish feels rustic and homemade, yet still special enough for a weekend brunch. Each spoonful offers a satisfying mix of tender vegetables, velvety yolk, and subtle heat.
    </p>
   
    <p>Topped with crumbled feta and fresh herbs, Shakshuka becomes even brighter and more flavorful, striking a balance between cozy and refreshing. It’s one of those dishes that looks impressive but is surprisingly simple to make, requiring just one skillet and about half an hour. Paired with crusty bread or warm pita, it’s a meal that works beautifully for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
